History for DBAHelper
=====================

v0.1.5
-------------------
* Generate_createdb.sh: Default Storage parameters for Tablespaces are now
  only generated for dictionary managed TS (causes errors on creating locally
  managed TS)
+ Generate_createdb.sh: Temporary TS statement is now also created
* Generate_createdb.sh: Rollback Segments are no longer created (and "altered
  online") when database is in auto undo mode
+ Generate_createdb.sh: added export of public synonyms and database links (not
  owned by SYS or SYSTEM).
+ Generate_createdb.sh: Now also creating roles
+ Generate_createdb.sh: CREATE USERS are now done with the correct password
  (using the undocumented "identified by values" feature)
+ analobj.sh now supports additional parameter --noanalyze (affects tables
  only, and then directly gives reports about chained rows)
* Generate_createdb.sh: Moved bootstrapping stuff to end of first segment
  (since these Oracle scripts stop spooling the log file)

v0.1.4 (14.07.2005)
-------------------
+ added the Generate_createdb.sh script to the package
* renamed idxrebuild.sh to idxrebuild_inv.sh (rebuilding all invalid
  indices)
+ new idxrebuild_all: now rebuilding all indices from the smallest to the
  largest (in bytes), and executing ALTER TABLESPACE..COALESCE in between

v0.1.3 (12.02.2004)
-------------------
+ added documentation in HTML format
* updated most script headers concerning the "Usage"/"Syntax" output
! idxrebuild: fixed problem with optional 2nd parameter

v0.1.2 (06.02.2004)
-------------------
! all: scripts crashed on objects with names using mixed case
+ all: enhanced command line syntax
+ analobj: LOGALL can now be overridden on cmdline
+ added tabreorg.sh (automatically re-organize fragmented tables)

v0.1.1 (26.01.2004)
-------------------
+ idxrebuild: the second parameter (tablespace name) now is optional. If not
  specified, all tablespaces (including SYSTEM!) are checked.
! idxrebuild: fixed condition for "STATUS" (now skipping 'N/A' as well, since
  rebuilding partitioned indices requires special treatment)
* all: moved remaining configuration options from analobj.sh to globalconf.
  So from now on "globalconf" should be the only file the user has to edit.
+ analobj.sh now optionally outputs complete log (logging all ANALYZE
  statements as well)

v0.1.0 (15.01.2004)
-------------------
* initial version (first release)

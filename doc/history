History for DBAHelper
=====================

v0.1.0 (15.01.2004)
-------------------
* initial version (first release)

v0.1.1 (26.01.2004)
-------------------
+ idxrebuild: the second parameter (tablespace name) now is optional. If not
  specified, all tablespaces (including SYSTEM!) are checked.
! idxrebuild: fixed condition for "STATUS" (now skipping 'N/A' as well, since
  rebuilding partitioned indices requires special treatment)
* all: moved remaining configuration options from analobj.sh to globalconf.
  So from now on "globalconf" should be the only file the user has to edit.
+ analobj.sh now optionally outputs complete log (logging all ANALYZE
  statements as well)

v0.1.2 (06.02.2004)
-------------------
! all: scripts crashed on objects with names using mixed case
+ all: enhanced command line syntax
+ analobj: LOGALL can now be overridden on cmdline
+ added tabreorg.sh (automatically re-organize fragmented tables)

History for DBAHelper
=====================

v0.2.2
-------------------
+ added the sqltune script (for Oracle 10g)
+ added script to list up undo records used by current processes

v0.2.1 (21.10.2007)
-------------------
! fixed configuration issue with backup_daily (UNTIL TIME parameter was missing)
! force_clean was incorrect
+ added script for full database export (with default options and optional compress)

v0.2.0 (23.08.2007)
-------------------
+ rman.sh: added recover command
* rman.sh: colors now only used when TERM variable set (avoid errors w/ cron)
+ rman.sh: added block_recover command
+ rman.sh: added commands cleanup_expired and cleanup_obsolete
+ rman.sh: added command force_cleanup. Use this with care. It's main intention
  is to work around a couple of Oracle bugs (see Metalink notes 4348860.1,
  314217.1, 315098.1, 305812.1, 289653.1 as well as bugs 5073511 and 5106952).
  In short: RMAN doesn't care about the archived logs directly stored into the
  FRA (flash recovery area), and also forgets to purge cumulative backups
  (leaving them orphaned w/o any parent to apply them on) - with the final
  result that the FRA size will be exceeded, further backups fail due to this,
  and the database comes to a stand-still since redo logs cannot be archived
  anymore. If you don't have this problem, you don't need this command.
+ rman.sh: added --yestoall option to allow unattended runs. Use this with care
  and only if you know what you are doing ;)
+ added documentation for the rman.sh script
* rman.sh: outsourced config to rmanrc
+ rman.sh: added cmd line options '-q' and '--dryrun'
+ rman.sh: made TempTS settings configurable

v0.1.8 (17.07.2007)
-------------------
! Generate_createdb.sh: fixed duplicate execution of CREATE USER statements
! Generate_createdb.sh: fixed execution order: Don't change password for SYSTEM
  and then try to connect with the old password later
! Generate_createdb.sh: for system managed tablespaces, last datafile was added
  twice - fixed.
+ added RMAN scripts (no documentation yet - simply run rman.sh w/o args to
  find out more)

v0.1.7 (24.02.2006)
-------------------
* lazywaste.sh: some restructuring
* updated some help messages within the scripts
+ added parameter --force to idxrebuild_all.sh, tabmove.sh and tabreorg.sh
+ idxrebuild_all.sh, tabreorg.sh: Now (optionally) also adjusts size of
  initial/next extent (based on index size). Use parameter --noadjust to ommit.
! if the scripts have been run without the -s parameter, and the given SID
  did not resolve via ONAMES/TNSNAMES, connection failed. Fixed.

v0.1.6 (11.01.2006)
-------------------
+ tabreorg.sh: Added parameter --nostats to force rebuild (e.g. if no stats
  have been collected, so we know nothing about chain count etc.)
+ added lazywaste.sh to find out about wasted resources and lazy sessions
* Generate_createdb.sh: Now using the print wrapper (from OraRep) (fixes some
  broken output)

v0.1.5 (27.10.2005)
-------------------
* Generate_createdb.sh: Default Storage parameters for Tablespaces are now
  only generated for dictionary managed TS (causes errors on creating locally
  managed TS)
+ Generate_createdb.sh: Temporary TS statement is now also created
* Generate_createdb.sh: Rollback Segments are no longer created (and "altered
  online") when database is in auto undo mode
+ Generate_createdb.sh: added export of public synonyms and database links (not
  owned by SYS or SYSTEM).
+ Generate_createdb.sh: Now also creating roles
+ Generate_createdb.sh: CREATE USERS are now done with the correct password
  (using the undocumented "identified by values" feature)
+ analobj.sh now supports additional parameter --noanalyze (affects tables
  only, and then directly gives reports about chained rows)
* Generate_createdb.sh: Moved bootstrapping stuff to end of first segment
  (since these Oracle scripts stop spooling the log file)

v0.1.4 (14.07.2005)
-------------------
+ added the Generate_createdb.sh script to the package
* renamed idxrebuild.sh to idxrebuild_inv.sh (rebuilding all invalid
  indices)
+ new idxrebuild_all: now rebuilding all indices from the smallest to the
  largest (in bytes), and executing ALTER TABLESPACE..COALESCE in between

v0.1.3 (12.02.2004)
-------------------
+ added documentation in HTML format
* updated most script headers concerning the "Usage"/"Syntax" output
! idxrebuild: fixed problem with optional 2nd parameter

v0.1.2 (06.02.2004)
-------------------
! all: scripts crashed on objects with names using mixed case
+ all: enhanced command line syntax
+ analobj: LOGALL can now be overridden on cmdline
+ added tabreorg.sh (automatically re-organize fragmented tables)

v0.1.1 (26.01.2004)
-------------------
+ idxrebuild: the second parameter (tablespace name) now is optional. If not
  specified, all tablespaces (including SYSTEM!) are checked.
! idxrebuild: fixed condition for "STATUS" (now skipping 'N/A' as well, since
  rebuilding partitioned indices requires special treatment)
* all: moved remaining configuration options from analobj.sh to globalconf.
  So from now on "globalconf" should be the only file the user has to edit.
+ analobj.sh now optionally outputs complete log (logging all ANALYZE
  statements as well)

v0.1.0 (15.01.2004)
-------------------
* initial version (first release)

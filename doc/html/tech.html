  The DBAHelper scripts are written using PL/SQL and Unix Shell. While PL/SQL
  code is used to work with the Oracle Database, Unix Shell code is used to
  construct the (anonymous) PL/SQL block (which is then executed) based on the
  users configuration.

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="require"></a>Requirements</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The requirements can directly be derived from the above paragraph and the
  intended goal: First, you need an Oracle Database Server up and running,
  otherwise you won't need any of the DBAHelper scripts :) Second, the instance(s)
  of this Database Server you want DBAHelper to work on need to have PL/SQL
  installed, otherwise the DBAHelper scripts cannot be processed by them. And
  last but not least, you need a Unix Shell (the DBAHelper scripts have been
  successfully tested with the Bash Shell). This does imply that the DBAHelper
  scripts do run in *nix environments (Linux, Solaris, AIX, etc. - successfully
  tested just with RedHat Linux 7.x, other reports are welcome). There are
  Shell environments available for Windows as well, like CygWin - but since I
  didn't test any scripts in those environments I cannot guarantee that they will
  run with those; again, reports are welcome.

  These scripts have not been approved by a "beta tester team" or the like, so
  you should consider them still in beta stage. This may change if people like
  you work with the scripts <b><i>and send me their reports</i></b> - not only
  if they encounter problems, but also if everything works well. I'm always happy
  to receive reports on where my tools are running fine. This not only encourages
  a developer - it also helps the user who needs approvement. Of course, if there
  are any errors, you should report them as well ;)

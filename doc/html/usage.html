  <p>The <code>Generate_createdb.sh</code> script can be used to
  <code>generate</code> a <code>create database</code> script from the
  information stored within a running instance, which can be called
  "reverse engineering". If you saved these scripts after setting up your
  instance, you may not need to do this -- but sometimes you miss these
  scripts and want to be prepared for the "worst case".</p>
  <p>As stated in the header of the script itself, it is in no way complete
  or certified -- as it is not the recommended way to get the create scripts.
  But sometimes there's no other option left, if that important information is
  lost -- so <code>Generate_createdb.sh</code> at least gives you something to
  start with. After the scripts have been created, you should check them
  thoroughly for any mistakes, errors and missing information. The script does
  not take care for all the latest features you may have used, but however it
  should create valid scripts for Oracle versions 8i and 9i.</p>

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="analobj"></a>analobj.sh</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  <p>As already mentioned in the introduction, <code>analobj.sh</code> is intended
  to <code>anal</code>yze <code>obj</code>ects in a given schema. This is
  necessary to provide the Cost Based Optimizer (CBO) with necessary data for
  indices and tables - but for tables it is also good to know about their
  fragmentation, i.e. the count of chained or migrated rows. With too many
  migrated rows, Oracle may be chasing blocks when fetching rows: while an
  index tells the requesting process, the wanted table row is stored in block X,
  in block X we find the information "look also in block Y" - and this only since
  there was not enough free space available on an update, since the block was
  already filled up.</p>
  <p>To get rid of this ugly situation, we need to re-organize the table.
  <a href="#tabreorg"><code>tabreorg.sh</code></a> helps you to do this automatically.</p>
  <p><code>analobj.sh</code> expects at least 3 command line options:<ol>
   <li>the <code>ORACLE_SID</code></li>
   <li>the schema to analyze</li>
   <li>the object type to analyze</li>
  </ol>Valid object types are <code>table</code>, <code>index</code> and
  <code>all</code>, where "all" means "tables and indices". If you do the analyze
  for the CBO, you should analyze "all" objects. If you are just going to identify
  tables with row migration, you may want to analyze "tables" only. I have no
  idea why someone may want to analyze indices only - but for the sake of
  completeness I included this possibility as well.</p>

  <p>Indices are a good invention to boost performance for many queries. But the
  best boost in this context can be reached by having the indices stored on a
  volume (i.e. hard disk) other than the data itself, since this way we can save
  even more disk IO.</p>
  <p>But not all applications (and developers) take enough care about using
  different tablespaces for data and indices respectively. Now Oracle has a
  <code>default tablespace</code> clause in the <code>CREATE USER</code> and
  <code>ALTER USER</code> statements, and since Oracle 9 a <code>default
  temporary tablespace</code> as well - but no such thing as a <code>default index
  tablespace</code>, unfortunately. So on a <code>CREATE INDEX</code> command
  without explicitely defining a tablespace for it, the index will be created
  within the users default tabelspace, as well as the tables etc.pp.</p>
  <p>So that's the time of <code>idxmove.sh</code>: it looks in the <code>SourceTS</code>
  whether there are any indices contained, and if so, moves them into the
  <code>TargetTS</code> using the <code>ALTER INDEX..MOVE</code> command. If
  possible, the move will be done with the <code>ONLINE</code> option, so no
  running session will be affected by this process.</p>
  <p><code>idxmove.sh</code> expects at least 3 parameters:<ol>
   <li>the <code>ORACLE_SID</code> (as usual)</li>
   <li>the <code>SourceTS</code> to look for the indices to be moved</li>
   <li>the <code>TargetTS</code> to move the indices to</li>
  </ol>For more options, see the <a href="#cmdline">command line</a> options
  above.</p>

 <tr><td class="text">
  <p>If indices become invalid, you may notice strong performance loss for
  applications that were using it due to Oracle executing Full Table Scans (FTS)
  instead of finding the row id(s) via the index. In some cases, the entire
  application may stop working (or at least it may seem so) and become unusable
  due to its bad performance. This is an intolerable situation - but thanks to
  <code>idxrebuild_inv.sh</code> we can overcome it quickly and easy:</p>
  <p><code>idxrebuild_inv.sh</code> queries the system views for indices that are
  in unusable state and then tries to rebuild them using the <code>ALTER
  INDEX..REBUILD</code> command. If rebuilding an index failes, this is reported
  within the log file written by a line starting with an exclamation mark ("!").</p>
  <p><code>idxrebuild_inv.sh</code> requires the <code>ORACLE_SID</code> as first
  parameter. As a second, optional parameter you may specify a tablespace to
  restrict the check to. More optional command line parameters can be found
  in the <a href="#cmdline">command line</a> section of this document.</p>

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="idxrebuild_all"></a>idxrebuild_all.sh</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  <p>Over time, indices can become inperformant since they loose balance due to
  (frequent) updates/inserts. And as well they may use more space than needed
  because of deletes. Thus to make them performant again as well as to re-gain the
  waisted space, a rebuild cannot be that bad an idea.</p>
  <p><code>idxrebuild_all.sh</code> checks your database dictionary for the
  existing indices with more than 1 extent in use (for the smaller ones we don't
  gain much speed, and especially no space). This list will be ordered by the
  space consumed by each index. Then it processes this list from top to bottom.
  First it tries to <code>REBUILD ONLINE</code> and, if this fails, without the
  online option (except you uncomment that statement in the script). At 3 times
  during this process it will <code>COALESCE</code> the tablespace (if you specified
  one):</p><ul>
  <li>50% of the index count or 1/3 of the size have been processed</li>
  <li>75% of the index count or 2/3 of the size have been processed</li>
  <li>all indices have been processed</li></ul>
  <p>This way chances are good that the largest index may be successfully rebuild,
  even if in the beginning it looked like you did not have enough space for this.</p>
  <p>The syntax of this script (and the logfile format) is the same as for
  <code>idxrebuild_inv.sh</code> above.</p>

  <p>As with Oracle 9, each tablespace can have its own block size settings: so
  while having one tablespace with 8k block size, we can have another with 16k
  block size for larger objects. So if we want to convert a tablespace, this may
  be one reason to use <code>tabmove.sh</code> to get all the tables there.
  Another possible reason is that tables and indices have been stored into the
  same tablespace, and we just want to move the tables out here while the indices
  should stay in this tablespace.</p>
  <p><code>tabmove.sh</code> expects at least 3 parameters:<ol>
   <li>the <code>ORACLE_SID</code> (as usual)</li>
   <li>the <code>SourceTS</code> to look for the tables to be moved</li>
   <li>the <code>TargetTS</code> to move the tables to</li>

  <p>If tables are fragmented (see <a href="#analobj"><code>analobj.sh</code></a>),
  this can become a performance issue. To automatically remove this fragmentation,
  I wrote the <code>tabreorg.sh</code> script. In order to get rid of the
  fragmentation plus help to prevent it in the future, it takes the following
  steps:<ol>
   <li>Checking for tables where the fragmentation exceeds a given treshhold</li>
   <li>temporary moving the table to another tablespace, using the <code>ALTER
       TABLE..MOVE</code> command, as described for
       <a href="#tabmove"><code>tabmove.sh</code></a></li>
   <li>Adjusting <code>PCTFREE</code> and <code>PCTUSED</code> as specified in
       the configuration file</li>
   <li>Moving the table back into its original tablespace</li>
  </ol>We have to move the table as described, as we can only get rid of the
  fragmentation by exporting and re-importing the entire table. We adjust the
  values for <code>PCTFREE</code> and <code>PCTUSED</code> <b><i>before</i></b>
  we transfer the table back to its original place, so these new values will
  have effect on all table rows (not only on the new ones).</p>
  <p>The only required parameter for <code>tabreorg.sh</code> (provided you set
  up the <code>TR_TMP</code> variable in the <code>globalconf</code> correctly)
  is the <code>ORACLE_SID</code> - more optional command line parameters can be
  found in the <a href="#cmdline">command line</a> section of this document.</p>

  The only results you can see immediately come with <code>analobj.sh</code>:
  the logfile provides you with a list of tables that exceed the configured
  threshhold values and you now may consider whether to reorganize them. As for
  the other scripts, just consult your logfile to see if there have been any
  problems (marked by a "!" in the beginning of a line). If there is no such
  line, and the script didn't crash for some reason, you should be able to tell
  the result by the intended action ;)

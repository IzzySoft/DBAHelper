   <li><b>Copy the scripts</b> (i.e. all files of the root directory of the distribution
       archive) into any directory you would like to run them from. Make sure to
       keep them all together in the same directory.</li>
   <li><b>Edit the <code>globalconf</code> configuration file.</b> Most important
       is to set the <code>user</code> and <code>password</code>, plus the
       <code>TR_TMP</code> option. For details, see the
       <a href="config.html">configuration</a> page.</li>

  That's all - now you should be able to use the scripts. Optionally you may want
  to put the scripts directory into your PATH to be able to execute them from
  everywhere - but that is up to you. If you succeeded up to this point, you should
  continue with the <a href="usage.html">usage</a> page to read important things
  about how to call the scripts. Maybe after a while you want to fine-tune your
  setup: read more about that on the <a href="config.html">configuration</a> page.
